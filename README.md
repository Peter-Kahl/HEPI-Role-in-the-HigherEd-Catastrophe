It’s remarkable how much you can uncover simply by diving into publicly available information. Today, I set out to learn exactly who and what drives the Higher Education Policy Institute (HEPI), which proudly calls itself ‘_the UK’s only independent think tank devoted to higher education._’

But how independent is it, really?

As I combed through publicly accessible financial statements, trustees’ reports, charity records, and company filings, a worrying web of influence and questionable governance emerged. Beneath HEPI’s polished public persona lies a troubling reality of overlapping fiduciary responsibilities, potential conflicts of interest, and apparent nepotistic practices.

### Consider these findings:

- Trustees with dual governance roles:
⋅⋅⋅⋅- Professor Dame Sally Mapstone, Chair of HEPI, simultaneously holds a senior position at Universities UK—raising serious questions about impartiality and independence.
⋅⋅⋅⋅- Professor Dame Helen Wallace also holds a trusteeship at the Bruges-Natolin UK European Scholarships Fund, adding another explicit layer of potential conflict.
- Nepotism concerns:
⋅⋅⋅⋅- Payments explicitly made by HEPI to relatives of its Director, Nicholas Hillman, for research and proofreading, raise fundamental questions about fiduciary compliance and fairness in HEPI’s decision-making processes.

### Why it matters:

HEPI’s claim of independence comes with an explicit responsibility: transparency. When influential organisations shaping national education policy claim neutrality, their governance practices must withstand scrutiny.

To address these issues head-on, I’ve prepared formal legal notices explicitly addressing fiduciary duties, conflicts of interest, transparency standards, data protection compliance, and fairness in governance. Six detailed letters—one to HEPI’s director and five to each trustee individually—are attached below.

Tomorrow morning, Monday, these letters will be dispatched by registered post, tracked and signed-for—ensuring explicit accountability and transparency in this critical dialogue.

I do not undertake this lightly. But as UK higher education faces an unprecedented governance and financial catastrophe, now more than ever we need genuine independence, transparency, and accountability from organisations shaping its future.

This is a collective fight. Your support, engagement, and amplification matter immensely.

Together, we can uphold the principles our education system truly deserves.

In solidarity,
